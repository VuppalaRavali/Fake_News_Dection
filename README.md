INTRODUCTION:-
Fake news detection has recently become a rising analysis that’s capturing attention. Pretend news is generated purposely to mislead readers to believe false data that makes it tough and non-trivial to discover supported content. Pretend news on social media has been occurring for many years, however, there's no united definition of the term ‘fake news’ For higher steering of the longer term directions of pretend news direction analysis, applicable classifications are necessary.<br/>
Fake news changes the manner folks interpret and answer real news, for example, some pretend news was simply created to trigger people's distrust and build them confused; preventative their skills to differentiate what is true from what is not. To help mitigate the negative effects caused by pretend news It's crucial that we tend to build up strategies to mechanically discover pretend news.<br/>
This project aims at learning the detection of pretend news victimization machine learning program in python.<br/>
In this project we are using SVC model, NB model and Machine learning algorithms to predict the news as real or fake.<br/>
Creating a data frame, process the data and do visualization number of real news and fake news. first we are using SVC model and count vectorization separately is the method 1.<br/>
In second method we are using pipeline with vectorization model. In this method we are predicting the news as real or fake. The multinomialNB and count vectorizer.<br/>
To save this project we are using joblib is created. this model is used for highest accuracy. Using the new model created using joblib , we should predict the output of newly entered piece of news. We are creating streamlit   webapp for fake News detector using the joblib model .<br/>
Finally the conclusion for this project the news is fake or real .<br/>
